title: Why this Blog
---

There have been some problems I've faced in my professional life that StackOverflow could be helpful at all. Usually the big community of web development is enough to find the solutions required for normal requirements. Sometimes there is a bug that neither your Technical Director have no clue about.

I'm the one who loves sharing the knowledge, that's why, after 10 years sipping from the community, I'll try to give something in return. My idea is to share some of the most recent problems where I gave more than the usual solutions that I found online.

Happy code, every one.
